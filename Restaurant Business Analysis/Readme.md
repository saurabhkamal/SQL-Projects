# Restaurant Business Analysis

Understanding the factors that drive business success is essential for stakeholders. This project leverages the Yelp dataset to explore the correlation between user engagement (including reviews, tips, and check-ins) and key success indicators for restaurants, such as review counts and ratings.

**Research Objectives:**

(a). Measure the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and business success indicators, including review count and average star rating. This will help us determine if restaurants with higher user engagement experience a corresponding increase in reviews and ratings.
(b). Examine how review sentiment affects both review count and average star rating. This will help us determine if positive sentiment in reviews and tips translates to higher star ratings. 
(c). Investigate time-based trends in user engagement patterns. This will help us determine if consistent user engagement over time is a stronger indicator of long-term success compared to sporadic bursts of activity. 

**Based on the research objectives, there are three hypothesis:**

(a). Increased user engagement, such as higher number of reviews, tips, and check-ins, is linked to greater review counts and higher restaurant ratings. 
(b). Positive sentiment in reviews and tips leads to higher overall ratings and increased review counts of restaurants.
(c). Steady engagement overtime is positively correlated with long-term business success for restaurants.
