Inference:
- The slight negative trend suggests that, generally, as the price increases, the number of orders decreases, but this effect is not strong.
- It's likely that other factors besides price are significantly influencing the number of orders, such as product quality, brand, market demand, or category-specific attributes.

Overall, the relationship between price and order count is not strong, indicating that simply lowering prices may not substantially increase order volumes for these products.
